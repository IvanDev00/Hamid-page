      <p>Hi everyone!</p>
      <p>
         My name is Ivan Hamid, and I'm a third-year computer science student at
         Palawan state university. My hobbies include coding, watching YouTube
         videos, gaming, and listening to music.

         I love learning about the different ways technology can be used to make
         the world a better place. It's amazing that we have the ability to do
         so much with computers and other devicesâ€”it's like they've become
         extensions of our bodies! For example, in my free time I enjoy playing
         video games (which are an excellent way to destress). I also like to
         watch videos online and listen to music.
