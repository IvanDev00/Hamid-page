<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, everyone!</h1>
<h3 align="center">My name is Ivan Hamid, and I'm a third-year computer science student at Palawan state university. My hobbies include coding, watching YouTube videos, gaming, and listening to music.

I love learning about the different ways technology can be used to make the world a better place. It's amazing that we have the ability to do so much with computers and other devicesâ€”it's like they've become extensions of our bodies! For example, in my free time I enjoy playing video games (which are an excellent way to destress). I also like to watch videos online and listen to music.</h3>
